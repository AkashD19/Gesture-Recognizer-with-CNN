Implementing Convolutional Neural Networks to recognize hand gestures:

1. Run the test5.py to recognise the hand and set a histogram. Every time a new hand is to be recognised it is better to create individual hand histograms.
2. Run testagain.py to capture different hand gestures and create the training dataset.
3. Run pehchan.py to run the main algorithm to train the images through CNN and test gestures in a real-time environment.
